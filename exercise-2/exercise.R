# Exercise 2: Creating data frames

# Create a vector of the number of points the Seahawks have scored in each game this season (google "Seahawks")

points.won <- c(12, 3, 37, 27)

# Create a vector of the number of points the Seahwaks have allowed to be scored against them in each game this season

points.lost <- c(10, 9, 18, 17)

# Combine your two vectors into a dataframe

seahawks.data <- data.frame(points.won, points.lost)

# Create a new column "diff" that is the difference in points

seahawks.data$diff <- abs(points.won - points.lost)

# Create a new column "won" which is TRUE if the Seahawks wom

seahawks.data$won <- points.won > points.lost


# Create a vector of the opponents

opponents <- c("Dolphins", "Rams", "49ers", "Jets")


# Assign your dataframe rownames of their opponents

seahawks.data$opponents <- opponents
